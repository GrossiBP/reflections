What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize new git repository it is empty, means that there is no commit done so I need to perform the commang git commit I believe 
in order to start logging my new history of files. At the moment I don't know how precisely the command must look like but next video 
will show it to me. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I can focus only on files that are now modified and this gives me opportunity to conecntrage only on them. If my project works ok
it means the modifications are ok and I can just think on modified files. Before commiting I can still test teh fiels and save also some
time before doing for example somoe more sofrware buildned

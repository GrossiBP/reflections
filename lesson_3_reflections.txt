When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I use couple of places with different machines and get access and add new files on the go from remote locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Someone else could make a change on a file that I don't want to have automatically on my local repository.

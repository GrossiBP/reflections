When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I use couple of places with different machines and get access and add new files on the go from remote locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Someone else could make a change on a file that I don't want to have automatically on my local repository. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks are done on github webpage

clones are the same repositories that can be obtain from remote location into local storage or can be done as well on local storage,
branch is separate context that is done on one repository
